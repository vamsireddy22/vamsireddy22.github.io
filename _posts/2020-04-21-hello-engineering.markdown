Since my childhood I am tired of listening to words like **"You can't do that!"**. After listening so, i wanted to shoutout **Yes, I  am, I can, I will if not me then who?**. 

Okay **Who am I ?**, oops sorry How would you know that?

Well I am **Vamsi** an undergraduate student at [GPREC](https://gprec.ac.in). I know you were not expecting that from me. Here we go, I am a self-thought minded guy, I always follow 3 E's principle. Well what is my 3 E's principle?
>1. Explore
>2. Experiment
>3. Experience 

And I always follow the motto:

And coming to my website I started working on 18-04-2020 after seeing some of my friends portfolio I thought it would better even if I start blogging to share my knowledge. Then I contacted my friend whome i met at HackVerse hackathon. He shared some sources for websites among those I really loved this one and also said to go with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to develop your website. I started reading [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) documentation, it was a really worth reading and coming to deployment,i went with github [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

> I released my website on May 1, cause the day is dedicated to people who work day and night to provide people with more comfort. This blog is my small dedication to all white collored labours out there who work so hard to Built something new, innovative for enrichment of human kind.

## Conclusion

The idea of creating website and starting blog was definitely worth it and moreover, got to pick up some new skills. Would recommend anyone to start blogging if you have enough knowledge because sharing knowledge and helping others is bliss, don't worry about your english some basic write up skills are enough and what not to say hold someone for proofreading your golden thoughts before publishing. There are certain features and fixes which I plan to do in due time. If you need any further help, feel free to take a look at the [repo](https://github.com/vamsireddy22/vamsireddy22.github.io.) or [contact me](https://vamsireddy22.github.io/contact) If there are any issues you come across, please do open up [here](https://github.com/vamsireddy22/vamsireddy22.github.io/issues) or would love it if you fix it :)
