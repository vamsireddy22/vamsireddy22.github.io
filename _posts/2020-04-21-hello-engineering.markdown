Since my childwood I am tired of listening the words **"You can't do that!"**. After listening this word i want shout like  **Yes, I  am, I can, I will if not me then who?**. 

Okay **Whom I am ?**, ho sorry How would you know that?

Well I am **Vamsi** an undergraduate student in [GPREC](https://gprec.ac.in). I know you are not expecting that from me. Here, we go I am a self-thought minded guy, I always follow 3 E's principle. Well what is 3 E's principle?
>1. Explore
>2. Experiment

And I always follow the motto:

And coming to my website I started working on 18-04-2020 after seeing some of my friends portfolio I thought it would better even if I start blog to share my knowledge. Then I contacted my friend who met in HackVerse he shared some sources for websites among those I really loved this one and also he said that go with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to develop your website. I started reading [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) documentation, it was a really worthfull reading and coming to deploying I choosen [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you love my website then why late? download code using following commands in your terminal and start designing: 

>- git clone https://github.com/vamsireddy22/vamsireddy22.github.io.git

## Conclusion

The idea of creating website and starting blog was definitely worth it and moreover, got to pick up some new skills. Would recommend anyone to start blogging if you have enough knowledge because sharing knowledge and helping others is bliss, don't worry about your english some basic write up skills are enough and what not to say hold someone for proofreading your golden thoughts before publishing. There are certain features and fixes which I plan to do in due time. If you need any further help, feel free to take a look at the [repo](https://github.com/vamsireddy22/vamsireddy22.github.io.) or [contact me](https://vamsireddy22.github.io/contact) If there are any issues you come across, please do open up [here](https://github.com/vamsireddy22/vamsireddy22.github.io/issues) or would love it if you fix it :)
