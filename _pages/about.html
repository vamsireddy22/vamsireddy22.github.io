Hello, I am Bheemireddy Vamsi, pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.gprec.ac.in/">GPREC</a>, Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh. I am a hard-working, enthusiastic, passionate developer and would love to contribute to the community. 

I have done two internships so far, one is remote internship in Centrique, USA during the summer 2020. Another one is at Agastya International Foundation, Bangalore, India during my 2019 summer vacation. 

I am a Web Developer with the interests in Computer Vision, Data Science, Data Structures.

I am very passionate about cooking and I always love to try new recipies, eventhough it's hard it gives lot of satisfaction when things come out good. In the same way I would like to learn new technologies and keep myself updated to current trends even though it is difficult.
