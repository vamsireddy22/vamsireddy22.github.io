Hello, I am Bheemireddy Vamsi, currently working as a Software Development Engineer 1 at Amazon, Bangalore. Previously I worked as an Associate Software Engineer at Eze Software, Hyderabad. I completed graduation in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.gprec.ac.in/">GPREC</a>, Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh. I am a hard-working, enthusiastic, passionate developer and would love to contribute to the community. 

I have done two internships, one is remote internship in Centrique, USA during the summer 2020 as ML Researcher. Another one is at Agastya International Foundation, Bangalore, India during my 2019 summer vacation, where I worked on a project based on Computer Vision and owned the end to end software developement life cylce of project. 

After working in two different products in my 2.5 Years of experience, I got a chance work on wider tech space like NodeJs, Java, React, DotNet, TypeScript and with Amazon AWS.

I am very passionate about cooking and I always love to try new recipies, eventhough it's hard, it gives lot of satisfaction when things come out good. In the same way I would like to learn new technologies and keep myself updated to current trends even though it is difficult.
